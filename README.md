Jax Calculator
========

- Why do modern calculator apps still look like my dad's [TI-1250](http://mycalcdb.free.fr/main.php?l=0&id=1749) from the 70s?
- Why do we count on our fingers, but mash virtual buttons to talk to computers about math?
- If the calculator were invented today, what would it be like?  
- Why do we need clever [infographics](http://demonocracy.info/infographics/usa/us_debt/us_debt.html) to show us what big numbers really mean?
- How does my 5 year old son know how to add already... as long as he uses poker chips?
- Why do I think showing him a typical calculator would ruin that?

The Jax Calculator is an attempt to answer these questions. 

I love you Jax.
